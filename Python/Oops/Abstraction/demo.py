Achieved in Python mainly using:

Abstract Classes (from abc module)

Interfaces (Python doesnâ€™t have direct interfaces, but abstract classes can act as them)

class Vehicle(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):

    def start(self):
        print("Bike started")

for i in list:
    i.start()
